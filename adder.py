#variable
answer1 = float(input("what is the first number: ")) # answer1 is a variable, it stores the the output from the "input" function.
#the output is a string (text), so to add them, we convert into a float (a decimal number) as we want to add them later

answer2 = float(input("what is the second number: ")) # nearly the same as the line 2
print(answer1+answer2) #adds the 2 numbers, then prints them
